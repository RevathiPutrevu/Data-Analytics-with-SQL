**Business Context**

A lot of people in the world share a common desire: to own a vehicle. A car or an automobile is seen as an object that gives the freedom of mobility. Many now prefer pre-owned vehicles because they come at an affordable cost, but at the same time, they are also concerned about whether the after-sales service provided by the resale vendors is as good as the care you may get from the actual manufacturers. New-Wheels, a vehicle resale company, has launched an app with an end-to-end service from listing the vehicle on the platform to shipping it to the customer's location. This app also captures the overall after-sales feedback given by the customer.


**Objective**

New-Wheels sales have been dipping steadily in the past year, and due to the critical customer feedback and ratings online, there has been a drop in new customers every quarter, which is concerning to the business. The CEO of the company now wants a quarterly report with all the key metrics sent to him so he can assess the health of the business and make the necessary decisions.

As a data analyst, the objective is to answer an array of questions from the executive level and provide insights and recommendations to the business using the data. 

 
**Data Description**

The data provided has

Attributes on the vehicles New-Wheels sells - What are the make, model, and year? What is the price point?
Attributes on the customers, such as where they live and payment methods
Attributes on orders and shipments, such as when the order was shipped and received, what the after-sales feedback was, and so on.

**Data Set**

The dataset used for the analysis is a part of the [Data Analytics Essentials](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/data-analytics-essentials-online-course) certification course offered by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.
